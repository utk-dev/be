### Website for Be
BE is a nonprofit organisation which designs human centric programs to build creative confidence & entrepreneurial spirit of young India.

This is an official project by myself in the role of a temporary web developer for BE. Some noteworthy things about this project:

1. This project uses HTML5 semantic tags to some extent.
2. Accessibility features are not guaranteed.
3. A form in this project sends data from the `index.html` page to an external server running a django based receiver and sqlite database.
4. While forking from this repository is perfectly allowed, images related to BE are copyrighted and their usage will be dictated by the BE's policies.
5. `backdrop-filter` css-property has been used in this project that does not support all major browsers yet (e.g. Firefox). For such browsers, a fallback has been provided.

There is no publicly available documentation for this project since documentation rights are reserved with BE and not me.

**Note: I do not work for BE.**
